# Shoestrap-Foundation

Make your [Shoestrap](http://shoestrap.org) theme use the [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/) framework instead of [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).

## CAUTION

If you activate this plugin, your previous theme settings will be lost.

Keep a backup of your settings BEFORE enabling this plugin.


### Installation

Install like a normal plugin and activate it.

Once you activate it, you will notice all the options in the Redux admin panel have changed. You will have to change a setting like for example the background color or the primary color to trigger the compiler and replace the previous stylesheet with the new one.
